			<h1 class="text-center">About Our farmers</h1>
			<p>India is a land of villages. A majority of her population
				lives in villages. Most of them are farmers. Agriculture is their
				main occupation. They work on the fields that are around the
				village. Indian economy is an agricultural one. So the importance of
				the farmer is very great. Let us examine, in brief, the life of an
				Indian farmer.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Hard working-An Indian Farmer is very hard working. He gets up
				early in the morning, takes his plough, and with his cattle goes to
				his field even before it is full daylight. He works there all day
				without caring for the hardships of the weather. Winter, summer or
				rain, it is all the same for him. We find him working on his field
				sowing, ploughing or reaping in biting cold as well as in the hot
				winds or summer.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>He works till noon, when his wife or children bring for him
				his mid- day meal. He takes it under the shade of some tree. Having
				eaten his food and having washed it down with a glass of cool water
				of a flowing brook or well, he again resumes his work. Often he
				sings a song to break the monotony of his hard labour.</p>
			<p>Village chaupal-It is only with the approach of darkness that
				he returns home. At the door of his humble cottage, he is greeted by
				his children, some young and some a bit grown up. Then he rests a
				while and smokes his hukka. This is the happiest time of the day for
				him. Now he is the king of his humble cottage. After taking his
				meal, he goes to the village chopal. There he smokes and chats with
				his fellow farmers, who like him, come there for recreation. Many
				jokes are cracked and the stories are narrated. In this way, having
				passed an hour or two in laughing and talking he returns home for
				his well earned rest.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Life : Full of difficulties-Such is a typical day in the life
				of an Indian farmer. His life is full of difficulties. In spite of
				his hard labour he lives a life of extreme poverty. He is born in
				debt, lives in debt, and dies in debt’. His crops are at the mercy
				of rains. Famines or floods often take away the fruits of his hard
				labour. Still he is contended and god fearing. When he falls ill, he
				finds that there are no medical facilities for his treatment. Often
				he dies untreated and uncared for there are also only a few schools
				for the education of his children. The mud huts in which he lives
				often fall down during rain and his humble belongings are all
				ruined. Pucca houses are rare. We, who live in the cities, cannot
				even imagine the hardships of his life.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Enjoys Nature’s Gift-But this is only one side of the picture.
				The Indian farmer has a brighter side also. He enjoys fresh air and
				sun- shine, the two great blessings of god. He gets more wholesome
				food than those who live in the cities. He still enjoys pure milk
				and ghee which are not to be found in cities. Moreover, the
				villagers are sympathetic and extend greater cooperation to each
				other in times of distress. Such fellow feelings and brotherhood are
				not heard of in the city, where even the next door neighbours do not
				know each other.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Need of reforms-A. number of reforms are needed to make the
				life of the farmer happier and healthier. It is a good sign that the
				government is giving its utmost attention to the problem. Various
				programmes of village upliftment have been taken in hand. Through
				scientific methods of agriculture, poverty is being removed. The
				prosperity of the farmer means the prosperity of the nation. In the
				near future his condition will surely improve.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Conclusion-The “Jawahar Rozgar Yojna ” was launched to improve
				the condition of life of the rural poor. ‘Panchayati Raj’ seeks to
				give power to the people to work out their own destiny. The central
				government promised that the loans of the farmers upto Rs. 10,000/-
				would be waived. The life of an Indian farmer twenty years hence
				would be quite different from his life today. He would be healthy,
				happy and prosperous. He would no longer be in debt, as at present,
				but would walk with his head raised high. He would be an entirely
				new man. Good quality seeds, fertilizers and pesticides are already
				being provided to him. Tractor training has now become a common
				sight. More and more improvements are taking place daily. So his
				future is bright.</p>

			<p>Indian farmers are second to none in production and
				productivity despite of the fact that millions are marginal and
				small farmers. They adopt improved agriculture technology as
				efficiently as farmers in developed countries. It is felt that with
				provision of timely and adequate inputs such as fertilizers, seeds,
				pesticides and by making available affordable agricultural credit
				/crop insurance, Indian farmers are going to ensure food and
				nutritional security to the Nation.It is envisaged to make available
				relevant information and services to the farming community and
				private sector through the use of information and communication
				technologies, to supplement the existing delivery channels provided
				for by the department. Farmers’ Portal is an endeavour in this
				direction to create one stop shop for meeting all informational
				needs relating to Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries
				sectors production, sale/storage of an Indian farmer. With this
				Indian Farmer will not be required to sift through maze of websites
				created for specific purposes.Once in the Farmers’ Portal, a farmer
				will be able to get all relevant information on specific subjects
				around his village/block /district or state. This information will
				be delivered in the form of text, SMS, email and audio/video in the
				language he or she understands. These levels can be easily reached
				through the Map of India placed on the Home page. Farmers will also
				be able to ask specific queries as well as give valuable feedback
				through the Feedback module specially developed for the purpose.</p>
