				<u>Cattle Feed</u>
			</h2>
			<div class="m-4">
				<p>IFFCO Kisan launched its Cattle Feed with an objective to
					provide a quality product for improvised cattle health and better
					milk production. IFFCO Kisan Balanced Cattle Feed contains
					necessary proteins, minerals, and vitamins, helping grow and
					maintain cattle and increase milk production.It is manufactured
					with the best quality grains, brans, molasses, minerals, and
					vitamins, which is highly palatable to the animals and helps
					maintain their overall health. Regular consumption of our cattle
					feed, increases the milk's density and quality, which further
					produces more butter and fat content in the milk. It is a balanced
					mixture of protein mineral vitamins, calcium carbohydrate fats as
					per animal requirement, prepared according to the National Dairy
					Development Board's guidelines. Boosts the animal's immunity,
					improves their digestive system, keeps the cattle safe from illness
					and infertility issues.</p>

				<p>It also helps in the calves' growth as it is a balanced
					source of essential nutrients. Hence they become young and
					reproducible on time. Having an appropriate amount of phosphorus
					and calcium, our balanced cattle Feed reduces the risk of diseases
					like milk fever and prolapse (body appearance) in cattle. Right,
					timely, and continued intake of balanced feed by the cattle helps
					cow/buffalo feed milk for a more extended period.</p>
