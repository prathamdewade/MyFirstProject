			<h3>Organic Farming</h3>
			<div class="m-5">

				<p>Organic farming, also known as ecological farming or
					biological farming,[1][2][3][4][5] is an agricultural system that
					uses fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure, green
					manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as
					crop rotation and companion planting. It originated early in the
					20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices.
					Certified organic agriculture accounts for 70 million hectares (170
					million acres) globally, with over half of that total in
					Australia.[6] Organic farming continues to be developed by various
					organizations today. Biological pest control, mixed cropping, and
					the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. Organic standards
					are designed to allow the use of naturally-occurring substances
					while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances.[7] For
					instance, naturally-occurring pesticides such as pyrethrin are
					permitted, while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are generally
					prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed include, for
					example, copper sulfate, elemental sulfur, and ivermectin.
					Genetically modified organisms, nanomaterials, human sewage sludge,
					plant growth regulators, hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock
					husbandry are prohibited.[8][9] Organic farming advocates claim
					advantages in sustainability,[10][11] openness, self-sufficiency,
					autonomy and independence,[11] health, food security,
					and food safety.</p>
				<h3>Dairy Farming</h3>
				<div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center m-3">

				</div>
				<p>Dairy farming is a class of agriculture for long-term
					production of milk, which is processed (either on the farm or at a
					dairy plant, either of which may be called a dairy) for eventual
					sale of a dairy product. Dairy farming has a history that goes back
					to the early Neolithic era, around the seventh millennium BC, in
					many regions of Europe and Africa. Before the 20th century, milking
					was done by hand on small farms. Beginning in the early 20th
					century, milking was done in large scale dairy farms with
					innovations including rotary parlors, the milking pipeline, and
					automatic milking systems that were commercially developed in the
					early 1990s. Milk preservation methods have improved starting with
					the arrival of refrigeration technology in the late 19th century,
					which included direct expansion refrigeration and the plate heat
					exchanger. These cooling methods allowed dairy farms to preserve
					milk by reducing spoiling due to bacterial growth and humidity.</p>

				<h3>Comercial Farming</h3>

				</div>
				<p>Commercial farming involves farming a single crop over the
					entire piece of land for the commercial purpose for say imports and
					exports of the crops. Growing a wide range of crops and raising
					animals for food, raw materials, or export are all part of
					commercial farming. This is done for financial gain.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Commercial farming, also known as agribusiness, is a farming
					method that involves growing crops, raising livestock, selling
					produce on the market, and making money. Commercial agriculture
					mainly produces high-demand crops.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Commercial farming mechanizes operations, controls diseases
					and pests, enabling the farms to produce more. As a result,
					commercial farmers increase production, helping increase the
					national stock of food products.</p>


				<h3>Crop Production</h3>

				<p>A crop is a plant or plant product that can be grown and
					harvested for profit or subsistence. By use, crops fall into six
					categories: food crops, feed crops, fiber crops, oil crops,
					ornamental crops, and industrial crops. Food crops, such as fruit
					and vegetables, are harvested for human consumption. Grains, such
					as corn, wheat, and rice, are the world’s most popular food crops.

					Food crops were the first crops to be harvested through
					agriculture. Agricultural development and the growth of
					civilizations led to the diversity of other types of crops.</p>
				<p>Fiber Crops Fiber crops, such as cotton and hemp, are
					harvested for textile and paper products. Textiles, or cloth, are
					made from the dried and processed fibers of certain plants. Most
					fibers used to make textiles are taken from the stem or roots of
					plants such as flax. Flax is used to make linen. Other parts of a
					plant can be harvested for fiber. Cotton, the most popular fiber
					crop in the world, is harvested from the light, fluffy “boll” of
					fiber that surrounds the plant’s seeds. Textiles made from bamboo
					are manufactured from the pulp of bamboo plants. Pulp from other
					fiber crops can be used in a variety of products. Fiber pulp may be
					used instead of wood pulp to manufacture paper products. The hemp
					plant is an interesting and controversial example of a fiber crop.
					The fibers of the hemp plant are strong and durable, perfect for
					products such as paper, textiles, ropes, nets, and sailcloth for
					ships. Hemp advocates see the plant as a versatile and ecological
					source of fiber. But some varieties of the hemp plant are used to
					make marijuana, a psychoactive drug. Marijuana is illegal to grow
					and use in many parts of the United States. (The drug is legally
					grown and sold for medical or recrecational use in some places.)
					Opponents of hemp argue that increased harvesting of hemp crops
					will lead to increased production and use of marijuana.</p>


				<h3>Planting</h3>

				</div>
				<p>Seeds or seedlings are sown or transplanted into the prepared
					soil. Farmers ensure proper spacing, depth, and timing for optimal
					germination and establishment of crops. Planting involves placing
					seeds or seedlings in the soil at the appropriate depth and
					spacing. It is crucial for successful crop growth and includes
					considerations such as seed quality, soil preparation, timing, and
					watering. Farmers must monitor the planted crops, provide
					protection from pests and diseases, and follow up with care and
					maintenance activities for optimal plant growth and development.</p>

				<h3>Livestock Farming</h3>
				<div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center m-3">

				</div>
				<p>Livestock farming involves raising animals for various
					purposes, such as meat, milk, eggs, and other products. It includes
					practices like cattle ranching, poultry farming, pig rearing, and
					sheep or goat farming. Livestock farmers provide proper nutrition,
					housing, healthcare, and breeding management to ensure the health
					and welfare of the animals. Livestock farming plays a significant
					role in food production, rural economies, and the overall
					agricultural industry. Livestock farming involves raising animals
					for various purposes such as meat, milk, eggs, wool, or other
					products. It includes practices such as breeding, feeding, housing,
					and health management. Livestock farmers play a crucial role in
					ensuring a sustainable and reliable supply of animal-based
					products. They strive to provide proper nutrition, care, and a
					conducive environment for the well-being of their animals while
					adhering to ethical and regulatory standards.</p>
